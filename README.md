# black-goat

The primary objective of this project is provide a platform for non-hierarchical
alignments among an unlimited number of authority systems. We conceptualize a
non-hierarchical alignment as a system of identity statements about concepts in
different authority systems. This is primarily intended for projects that
introduce a significant number of concepts in their own namespace, a substantial
proportion of which overlap with other authority systems. Projects can register
their own concepts, make statements about identities between those concepts and
those in other systems, and traverse those identity relations to align datasets
that rely on contrasting authority systems.

While Black Goat is envisioned to provide some basic tools for discovering
mappings between authorities, the primary use case is to provide support for
mappings generated in other ways (e.g. the Linked Open Data Enhancer).
